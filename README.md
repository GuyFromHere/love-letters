# love-letters
Location based message and image sharing app. Click [here](https://love-letters-gfh.herokuapp.com/) to try it out (preferably from your smart phone).

# Concept

When I heard the first stories of the toll COVID-19 was taking on other countries early on my impulse was to reach out to those affected and offer some kind of support. I thought of this project as a way to feed a little positivity in to the world. When you're thinking of someone in need, send them a positive note. A "love letter". 

# How To Use The App

Click on a location and select the Camera to live a picture or the Keyboard to leave a note. 

When finished, send your note and an icon will appear where you left it on the map. 

Click the icons to see or read notes left by others. 

Use the search bar to travel around the world leaving and / or reading notes!
